The "Nerd" file is the main code. Starting here takes you through a flowchart that asks questions to guide character class choice, and gives an option to choose your race. 
If a caster class is chosen through the flowchart, additional questions help refine which spells you will start with. 
"Melee" refers to weapons fighting, not solely close combat.
The final output is the character stat block, any noteable features, and if a caster, a list of cantrips and first level spells that you start with.
This is for a Level One character, using the 2014 5e Player's Handbook rules and spells list. No additional books are included.
