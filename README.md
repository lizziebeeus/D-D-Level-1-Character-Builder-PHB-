<H1>Dungeons & Dragons Level 1 Character Builder</H1>

<H2>This is a Level 1 character builder that walks you through a series of questions to help choose your class and race, and assigns spells for caster classes.</H2>

When I began playing Dungeons & Dragons, I was overwhelmed by all of the choices I had for character building and I wasn't sure where to start. I built this program to help new players design a character with less stress. The program utilizes the Player's Handbook, 5th Edition, 2014 rules. 

The program begins with a series of questions designed to determine which class the player would enjoy the most. If the determined class is a caster type, the program will ask additional questions to determine if the player prefers to play offensively, in a support role, or a mix of the two, and assign spells accordingly. If there are not enough spell options of the user's chosen type, it will return a note that says "Number of [spell level] is reduced based on choices". 

The output consists of the player's race, class, stat block, and spell list if applicable. 

<B>Note:</B> "Melee" refers to any form of non-spell-based combat, not specifically close-combat options. 

All files must be in the same directory folder in order for the program to function correctly. "Nerd" is the main file that must be initiated to run the program, but all files are necessary for proper function.
